# Docassembly Line Integrated Testing: Experiments

## Uses
- mocha
- chai
- puppeteer
- cucumber
- docassemble

Note: This is not behavior driven development. This is unit testing. End-to-end unit testing is not the typical use of libraries like cucumber, but it is what these projects need to ease the development process.
